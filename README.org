* Jelly Proto
prototype for a thing I called jelly

* Note on languages
the thing in question, as the =J= in the name implies, is in java, or at least it's gonna be in java, once I get on doing it

the prototype is in haskell, because
 - I like haskell
 - it works well for faster prototyping
 - the sheer amount of builtins for string manipulation
 - type systems up the wazoo might force me not to pull a lispy


most the repo is =TeX= because most the repo is me documenting the repo to better figure out can I pull this off in java.
(the docs are in org mode but I've pdf'd em all)
